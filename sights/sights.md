### Elora Gorge

### Waterloo Park (espc. during December)
This is probably the closest park to Campus, and has a lot of hidden gems lots of people don’t seem to know about. There’s a ton of soccer fields, a small zoo, and a nice lake with an amazing scene around it. It’s great for photo trips, or solitary existential walks whenever you get too many Jobmine rejections.

During December, the path leading from Seagram into Waterloo park turns into a Winter Wonderland of sorts, and is a nice, warm (metaphorically) place to be.

### Columbia lake

### Grand River Trail

### Victoria Park

# Attractions

### THEMUSEUM

### Glass and clay museum
Free museum south of Waterloo Park. There’s usually a rolling exhibit by local artists, and it’s always a nice stroll if you’re into art. Shouldn’t take more than an hour to go through it all.
