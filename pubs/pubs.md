### Morty’s Pub
Wings, beer, and great company? What else can you ask for? Hop on by on Mondays or Thursdays, after 3 pm for their wings specials. ($7/lb or $13.5/2lb) Lines can get long around dinner, so consider heading out a bit earlier in case.

### Bomber Info Sessions
As they say, the best beer is free beer. So, head on out to the Bomber during info sessions to have some drinks, eat some food, and hang out with friends (and the hosting company, of course).
