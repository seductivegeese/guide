### Grand River Rocks (GRR)
Want to give rock climbing a try? GRR is located in Kitchener and is a bus ride away. Lots of bouldering and wall climbing spots, with a very supportive staff and community. A day pass can be had for $14 with student ID. Can sometimes find Patrick Lam here.

### PAC secrets:
Bouldering wall
Squash
Badminton (almost available everyday)
-> How do i get to the pool

### J&J Collectibles
A rather large board game store on Weber, and it is surprisingly enough one of the largest ones I’ve ever seen. You’ll find anything you ever want here, from nerf guns to Magic the Gathering cards to obscure hipster board games. Decent pricing as well, definitively cheaper than ordering off Amazon.

### Games on Tap
### Crossroads
### Hardware store in Cambridge
### Biking:
- There’s a nice off the road bike trail behind the Boardwalk, one of the best in the country apparently

- For commuting/urban biking, the Laurel Trail in Waterloo + Iron Horse trail in Kitchener serve as the city’s main biking arteries, passing through both downtowns.

- The new Spur Line trail is useful for going to the east side of the city

- Good places to get bikes: Recycle Cycles in Kitchener, King Street Cycles / McPhails in Waterloo, sometimes the UW bike auction (seems oversubscribed recently).

### Movies:
Apollo cinema

Princess Cinemas

Landmark Cinemas at the Boardwalk

Galaxy Cinemas at Conestoga

### Geocaching

### Ctrl-V

### Escape Room

### Chicopee (Ski Hill + Tube Park)

### [KwartzLab KW](http://www.kwartzlab.ca/)
